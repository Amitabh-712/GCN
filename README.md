# GCN
Semi-supervised classification on Graph Convolutional Networks

Why GCN?

Graphs are ubiquitous. Citation Networks, Knowledge Graphs and Social networks can all be modeled as graph. 
This has many uses, for example, detecting fraudulent accounts and controversial tweets.
Graph convolution networks make use of the graph structure and the node representation.
